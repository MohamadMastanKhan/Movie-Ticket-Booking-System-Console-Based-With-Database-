**Console-Based Movie Ticket Booking System**

**Overview**

This is a Java-based console application for booking movie tickets, integrating Hibernate ORM for database management. The system follows object-oriented principles and allows users to book tickets, apply coupons, make payments via UPI, and store booking details in a database.

**Features**

User Authentication: Signup, login, reset credentials.

Movie Booking: Select location, movie, theatre, date, and showtime.

Seat Allocation: Dynamic seat assignment.

Payment Integration: Supports GPay, Paytm, and PhonePe via UPI.

Discounts: Apply coupons for discounts.

Food Ordering: Option to add food to booking.

Database Management: Stores bookings using Hibernate ORM.
